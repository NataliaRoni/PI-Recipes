# Recipes App 🚀

Welcome to the Repository of my Individual Project at Henry! This application allows users to explore, search, filter, sort, create, and delete recipes. Discover new recipes and share your own creations!

## Key Features 🌟

- **Recipe View:** Recipes are presented in the order they are fetched from the external API, with pagination for a better viewing experience and the ability to sort them according to nutritional index and from A to Z.

- **Recipe Search:** You can search for recipes by their name using the search bar. Additionally, there's a button that allows you to reset the filters.

- **Recipe Details:** Displays the characteristics of the recipe, nutritional index, image, description, and step-by-step instructions.

- **Filters:** You can apply various filters, such as dietary types for each recipe, filter between API and database recipes, etc. All filters can be used together to refine your search.

- **Create Recipe:** I have implemented a validated form that allows you to create new recipes to your liking. These custom recipes can also be deleted.
